> single-cell RNA seq tutorials for begginers

I am recently starting to work with single-cell analyses, something that is taken me a while since I have been wandering on the internet attempting to learn the basics. I decided to create this post to share with you some tutorials that have been really useful for me as a begginer. Please, feel free to contribute or give any feedback.
